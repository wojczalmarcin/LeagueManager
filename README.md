# LeagueManager

This is a sandbox project which aims to explore capabilities of various .NET libraries with combination of a Domain-Driven Design approach.

Please note that while the code is written in a DDD style, the domain has not been fully discovered and designed. This project is primarily focused on experimenting with how different libraries can be useful within a DDD approach. As such, the implementation may not reflect a complete or fully realized domain model.

Nuget packages in use:

- Entity Framework Core
- MediatR
- FluentValidation
- OneOf
- Mapperly
- Ulid
